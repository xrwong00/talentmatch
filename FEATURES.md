# TalentMatch — AI Features Summary

## 🎯 Core Innovation: Career Evolution, Not Just Job Matching

### Problem Statement
Traditional graduate job platforms fail because they only show job listings. Graduates browse, apply, and hope—without understanding:
- Who they can become
- What their career trajectory looks like
- How to bridge skill gaps

### TalentMatch Solution
We transform job hunting into **career evolution** with three AI-powered pillars:

---

## 🧠 1. AI Persona Profiling

### The Experience
**Upon sign-up**, candidates encounter a unique onboarding flow:

1. **3-Minute Reflection Timer**
   - Modal pops up with countdown (180 seconds)
   - Prompts to reflect on:
     - Favorite subjects/projects
     - Proud skills (technical + soft)
     - Ideal work environment
     - 2–5 year vision

2. **Flexible Input**
   - Type their reflection (textarea)
   - OR speak it (voice recording button)
   - Example: *"I am an engineering student with great skills in soldering, circuit design, and embedded systems. I love working on IoT projects and want to work in hardware development..."*

3. **AI Analysis**
   - Loading animation: "Analyzing your profile..."
   - AI predicts career path:
     - **Day-1 roles**: "Junior Hardware Engineer"
     - **2–3 year path**: "Senior IoT Developer"
     - **5+ year path**: "Technical Lead"

4. **Personalized Profile**
   - Strengths identified (Circuit Design, Embedded Systems, Problem Solving)
   - Growth areas suggested (Cloud IoT, Team Leadership, Product Management)

### Implementation Details
- Component: `app/components/AIPersonaModal.tsx`
- Features:
  - Countdown timer with `useEffect` hook
  - Toggle voice/text input
  - Character counter
  - Skip option (if user is ready before timer ends)
  - AI analysis simulation (2s loading)

## 🌱 2. Career Evolution Feed

### The Experience
**Dashboard shows TWO feeds**, not one generic job list:

#### Tab 1: Day-1 Roles
Entry-level positions you can **apply for immediately**:
- **Junior Hardware Engineer** at TechMalaysia Sdn Bhd
  - 95% Match
  - RM 3,500 - 4,500
  - Why? *"Your soldering & circuit design skills are a perfect match"*
  - Tags: Circuit Design, PCB, Embedded

#### Tab 2: Next-Step Roles (2–5 years)
Senior positions showing **where you'll be**:
- **Senior IoT Developer** at FutureTech Systems
  - 87% Match
  - RM 7,000 - 10,000
  - Timeline: 2–3 years
  - What you'll need: 3+ years experience, Cloud platforms, Team leadership

### Why This Matters
- Graduates see **career as a journey**, not just a job
- Understand skill gaps to close NOW for future roles
- Motivation: "I can become a senior developer in 3 years"

### Implementation Details
- Page: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Features:
  - Tabbed interface (`useState` for active tab)
