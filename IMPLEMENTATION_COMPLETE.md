   ↓
3. User completes 7-step wizard (or skips steps)
   ↓
4. User clicks "Complete Profile"
   ↓
5. profile_completed set to true → Redirect to /dashboard
   ↓
6. Future logins → Go directly to /dashboard
   ↓
7. User can return to /profile/setup anytime to edit
```

## 🔒 Security Highlights

### Row Level Security Policies
```sql
-- Users can only view their own data
create policy "Users can view their own work experience"
  on public.work_experience for select
  using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can only insert data for themselves
create policy "Users can insert their own work experience"
  on public.work_experience for insert
  with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
```
